# Queue-by-stack
This project implements a queue using a stack (specifically, MyStack) by inheriting from a Queue base class and overriding its functions to support enqueue, dequeue, front, and isEmpty operations efficiently.
# Features

Efficient Operations: Queue operations (enqueue, dequeue, front, isEmpty) are implemented using a stack (MyStack) to achieve O(1) time complexity for most operations.

Inheritance: The QueueStack class inherits from a base Queue class, providing a modular and extensible design.
